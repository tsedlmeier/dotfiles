## [3.0.13] - 2021-08-24

### Fixed

- Update `<leader>dc` to match new config setup, ref [#101](https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/doom-nvim/pull/101). See [#102](https://github.com/NTBBloodbath/doom-nvim/pull/102)

- More automation, plugins configurations will automatically take effect
  and the plugins will be automatically installed or uninstalled too, say bye
  to `PackerClean` and `PackerInstall` commands!
- The language servers can be automatically installed now by adding a `+lsp`
  flag in the `doomrc` languages field, e.g. for adding `rust` support and adding
  `rust-analyzer`: `'rust +lsp'`.
